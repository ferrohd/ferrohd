# Ferro's Website

This is the source code for my personal website, which is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). It is a simple, static website that showcases my projects and provides a way to contact me.

Being a backend/infra engineer, I ~~hate frontend development~~ wanted to keep the website simple and easy to maintain, so I chose to use a static site generator.

The website is hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), which is a free, fast, and easy-to-use static site hosting service.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
